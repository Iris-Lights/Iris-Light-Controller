Message Parsing Stage 1. )
    -> Message is received by a Message Retriever (Any Retriever represented by the MessageRetreiver base class)
    -> This message is stored as a string of json, and is passed onto the MessageManager.

Message Parsing Stage 2. )
    -> At this stage, the Message Manager has the string representation of a message.
    -> The Message Manager will turn this message reprentation into a JSON Object (using ArduinoJSON)
    -> The Message Manager ensures that the message is semantically valid in terms of json.
       The Message Manager does not ensure that the message has any true semantic meaning,
       only that the message is parsable into json. 
    -> Here, the json object is passed onto the correct MessageDecoder. Once the MessageDecoder has the
       object, it will ensure that the json object is semantically meaningful. If the message is meaningful,
       then whatever the message represented will be executed by the MessageDecoder.
